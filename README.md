# DoorSign
A PCB to be used as door sign.

* The board outline indicates the house number
* Silkscreen shows name and miscellanous information
* Mounting holes and hole for an illuminated ringer-button
* Footprints and layout to support a Raspberry Pi Pico (plain and W-version interchangeable), a LDR based light sensor, Neopixel LEDs and circuitry to detect a ringer-button press

Also firmware for the Pico to animate the LEDs suffering from feature-bloat. Guilty, pick a less capable chip next time.

Propably not useable directly by forking unless you happen to be me and live here. But if you find bits useful, go for it.
